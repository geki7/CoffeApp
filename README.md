# CoffeeApp
An application for cafes.
It allows user registration. Each registered user is by default a regular user, while an administrator can later change roles to head waiter or regular waiter.
The head waiter can order new drink supplies if necessary, as they constantly have insight into the current stock levels, as does the administrator. Waiters receive customer orders in the app and know which table they need to serve.
Users can reserve tables if a special event is organized for a particular evening.
All past orders are recorded in the database, making inventory checks much easier at any time.
